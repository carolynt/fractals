              <div class="paragraphs"><p>Gottfried Leibniz made the first steps towards the study of fractals in the 17th century, with more work being done from mathematicians such as Weierstrass, Cantor, Poincaré, and others throughout the 19th century.  However it was in the 20th century that the study of fractals really began to flourish, with Benoît Mandelbrot being the first to depict fractals using computers in the 1970s.</p></div>
              <div class="paragraphs"><p>Fractals are beautiful phenomena that are most often handled and expressed mathematically, although with many examples occurring in the natural world in everyday experiences including DNA and even vegetables.  Fractals generally have some degree of a self-similar pattern; that is, fractals are complex patterns that repeat themselves and, no matter how much you “zoom in” or “zoom out”, the image will always repeat itself and it will not look any different, or only look slightly different.  Think of looking at picture that shows a wall in an art gallery filled with paintings, and one of those paintings is a reproduction of the original painting that you’re looking at, and within the painting of the paintings on the wall, within the painting of itself, is the same exact scene of an art gallery wall and that same picture is again reproduced, only at a smaller scale.  And it goes on and on, itself within itself.  That’s how a fractal works.</p> </div>
                <div class="paragraphs"><p>While fractals are difficult to measure, they have a property known as “fractal dimension” which is a ratio of the change in detail to the change in scale.  Through the fractal dimension the levels of complexity of varying fractals can be compared.  It is also difficult to measure the “circumference" of a fractal: if we imagine taking a measuring tape and wrapping it very tightly into every edge and corner, the fractal would always have yet another nook in which to tuck a little bit more of the measuring tape into, making its circumference an infinite length.</p></div>
